## üîß Technology Stack

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (metadata) + Redis (time-series)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Encryption**: AES algorithm with public/private key pair
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core

## üö¶ Getting Started

1. **Authentication**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/auth/login
   ```

2. **Get Public Key for Encryption**
   ```bash
   GET /api/v1/encryption/public-key
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

3. **Create Industry**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/industries
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

4. **Add Monitoring Station**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/industries/{id}/stations
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

5. **Configure Sensors**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/stations/{id}/sensors
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

6. **Upload Encrypted Sensor Data**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/sensor-data
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   Content-Type: application/json
   
   {
     "company_id": "123",
     "station_id": "456",
     "channel_id": "789",
     "encrypted_data": "AES_ENCRYPTED_PAYLOAD_HERE",
     "timestamp": "2025-07-18T01:02:00Z",
     "signature": "HMAC_SIGNATURE"
   }
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Security & Encryption

### How It Works:
1. **Public Key Distribution**: End users receive public keys through the API
2. **Client-side Encryption**: Users encrypt sensor data using provided public keys and AES algorithm
3. **Secure Transmission**: Encrypted data is sent to the server via HTTPS
4. **Server Decryption**: Server uses private keys to decrypt and process the data
5. **Data Integrity**: HMAC signatures ensure data hasn't been tampered with

### Security Benefits:
- **End-to-End Protection**: Data is encrypted from sensor to server
- **Tamper-Proof**: Any modification during transmission is detected
- **User-Friendly**: Public keys enable easy integration with existing sensor software
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets data security requirements for industrial monitoring

## üì± Client Integration

End users can integrate with their existing sensor software by:
1. Obtaining public keys from the API
2. Implementing AES encryption in their sensor applications
3. Sending encrypted payloads to the data upload endpoints
4. Ensuring data integrity with proper signature validation

## üéØ Use Cases

- **Environmental Compliance** - SPCB/CPCB regulatory monitoring
- **Industrial IoT** - Real-time encrypted sensor data collection
- **Air Quality Monitoring** - Secure PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx tracking
- **Water Quality Monitoring** - Protected pH, BOD, COD, TSS measurement
- **Emission Monitoring** - Tamper-proof stack emission compliance

## üìã Compliance

Designed to meet Indian pollution control standards:
- Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines
- State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) requirements
- Online Continuous Emission Monitoring System (OCEMS) standards
